# Getting Paid to Work in the Lab

There are several ways undergraduates can get paid to conduct research in our lab. This page lists only the programs that are officially documented and available at UF.

This list is current to the best of my knowledge, as of January 2026.

## Competitive Stipend Programs

These are the main funded research scholarships available to UF undergraduates.

### University Scholars Program (USP)

**Stipend:** $1,750 (split: $750 fall, $1,000 spring)  
**Mentor support:** $500 for the faculty mentor to support the research  
**Commitment:** 8–10 hours/week for two consecutive semesters  
**Application deadline:** November (typically)  
**Eligibility:** Must not be graduating before May of the following year

The USP is the primary centralized undergraduate research funding program at UF. You work with a faculty mentor on a research project and receive a stipend.

**How to apply:** Contact me if you're interested. We'll develop a project proposal together and submit the application through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

- **Info:** [https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/programs-university-scholars-program/](https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/programs-university-scholars-program/)

### Emerging Scholars / Early Undergraduate Research

**Stipend:** $1,000 (split into two semesters)  
**Commitment:** 8–10 hours/week  
**Application deadline:** November  
**Eligibility:** 
- Freshman or Sophomore status ONLY
- NO previous research experience (including high school)

This program is specifically designed for students new to research. If you're a freshman or sophomore and have never done research before, this is an excellent entry point to get paid for your first research experience.

### Science for Life (UF-HHMI Program)

**Description:** "The largest early undergraduate research program at UF and in the State of Florida"  
**Target:** Freshmen and sophomores  
**Course:** 1-credit **IDH 3931** offered each fall and spring  
**Research timeline:** Multi-year research projects starting the summer after freshman year

Science for Life is funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and provides opportunities for undergraduates to engage in multi-year research starting early in their academic career.

### Beckman Scholars Program

**Funding:** Varies  
**Commitment:** 15 months continuous research  
**Eligibility:** Exceptionally competitive. Typically requires:
- GPA around 3.8+

**Application deadline:** February  
**Eligibility:** Must be nominated by your academic unit (CLAS departments nominate up to 2 students)

**Benefits:**
- $2,000 stipend for research and scholarship with a mentor
- $1,000 to fund research expenses, attend conferences, travel

Speak with your department about nomination eligibility.

## Direct Lab Employment

### OPS (Other Personnel Services) Hourly Positions

**Pay:** Typically $12–$16/hour (varies by experience and funding)  
**How it works:** Faculty hire undergraduates directly as hourly employees using grant funds, startup funds, or departmental funds

This is the most flexible way to get paid for lab work. Hours and duties are negotiated directly with the PI. These positions are **not** advertised through a central system — you need to ask the PI directly if they have funds to hire you.

**Can I get both pay AND course credit?** YES! You can be paid as an OPS employee and also receive research credit (BSC 4910, BSC 4912, BOT 4911, ZOO 4911), but you must contact the Undergraduate Coordinator to arrange it.

---

### Federal Work-Study (FWS)

**Pay:** Typically $15–$20/hour  
**Commitment:** Up to 20 hours/week during the semester  
**Eligibility:** Must demonstrate financial need on FAFSA and receive Federal Work-Study award

If you have Federal Work-Study in your financial aid package, PIs can hire you and a portion of your wages are covered by the federal government, making you less expensive to employ.

**How to find FWS positions:**
- Go to [https://explore.jobs.ufl.edu](https://explore.jobs.ufl.edu)
- Choose "Explore Jobs at UF"
- For "Work Type," choose "Student Ast."
- Search for "Federal Work Study" + "research" or browse biology-related positions

**Important:** Complete your FAFSA early each year (by October 1) to maximize your chance of receiving FWS funding.

**If you have Federal Work-Study, tell me immediately** — this makes it much easier for me to hire you.

- **Info:** [https://www.sfa.ufl.edu/types-of-aid/employment/](https://www.sfa.ufl.edu/types-of-aid/employment/)

## Research for Course Credit (Unpaid, But Documented)

### BSC 4910, BSC 4912, BOT 4911, ZOO 4911

**Credit hours:** 0–3 credits  
**Cost:** 0-credit courses are FREE (no tuition); 1–3 credits count toward your tuition cap if you're full-time  
**Benefits:** Documents research experience on your transcript; can be repeated for up to 6 total credits

Research credit is a great way to formalize your research experience. Graduate programs and professional schools look for research credit on transcripts.

**How it works:**
1. Contact me and agree on a research project
2. Complete the research proposal and application form (due before the first week of classes)
3. Register for the appropriate course
4. Submit a final written report at the end of the semester (minimum length: 750 words/1 credit, 1,300 words/2 credits)

**Important:** Biology majors taking BSC 4910 for the first time must also enroll in **BSC 3911 Entering Research** (1 credit). You don't repeat this co-requisite if you take BSC 4912 later.

## Research Grants to Fund Your Work

### URAP Undergraduate Research Grants

**Award:** $250  
**Deadline:** April  
**Who can apply:** Any undergraduate conducting research in Biology

---

### Sigma Xi Grant in Aid of Research

**Award:** $1,000

---

## Getting Started

1. **Talk to me first.** Let me know you're interested in paid research and we'll discuss current projects and your interests.

2. **Identify which funding mechanism fits you:**
   - Freshman/sophomore with no research experience? → **Emerging Scholars**
   - Junior/senior with good GPA? → **University Scholars**
   - Have Federal Work-Study? → **Tell me immediately** — this makes hiring you much easier
   - Qualifying for McNair/CLAS/Beckman? → Talk to me about whether you're competitive

3. **Check deadlines early.** Most competitive programs have fall applications (typically November) or spring applications. Plan ahead!

4. **Start with volunteer or credit, then apply for funding.** Many successful paid research students start by volunteering or taking research credit for a semester, then apply for competitive scholarships once they have experience and a strong relationship with their mentor.

5. **Visit the Center for Undergraduate Research (CUR)** at 202 Newell Hall for peer advising and help navigating applications.
