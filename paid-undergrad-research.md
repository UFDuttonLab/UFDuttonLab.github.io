# Getting Paid to Work in the Lab

There are several ways undergraduates can get paid to conduct research in our lab. This page lists all the structured funding programs available at UF, plus direct employment options.

---

## University-Wide Competitive Programs

### University Scholars Program (USP)

**Stipend:** $1,750 (split: $750 fall, $1,000 spring)  
**Commitment:** 8–10 hours/week for two consecutive semesters  
**Application deadline:** Varies by college (typically November–February)  
**Eligibility:** Must not graduate before the following spring; typically 3.0–3.5 GPA minimum (varies by college)

The USP is the main centralized undergraduate research funding program at UF. You work with a faculty mentor on a research project and receive a stipend. The faculty mentor also receives $500 to support the research.

**How to apply:** Applications go through the **mentor's college**, not yours. Since I'm in the Department of Biology (CLAS), you would apply through the CLAS University Scholars Program.

- **CLAS USP info:** [https://funding.humanities.ufl.edu/uf-internal-undergraduate-funding/](https://funding.humanities.ufl.edu/uf-internal-undergraduate-funding/)
- **General USP info:** [https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/programs-university-scholars-program/](https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/programs-university-scholars-program/)

**Important:** If you don't complete the program, you must repay the full amount to UF.

### Summer Undergraduate International Research Program (SUIRP)

**Funding:** Up to $500 travel support and/or stipend  
**Duration:** Summer  
**Eligibility:** UF undergrads with minimum 1 year research experience at UF, valid passport, not graduating before December of calendar year  
**Application deadline:** February

SUIRP provides funding for UF undergrads to conduct research at foreign institutions. If you're interested in international fieldwork or collaborations (e.g., Kenya field sites), this could support that work.

---

## Direct Lab Employment

### OPS (Other Personnel Services) Hourly Positions

**Pay:** Typically $12–$16/hour (varies by experience and funding)  
**How it works:** Faculty hire undergraduates directly as hourly employees using grant funds, startup funds, or departmental funds

This is the most flexible way to get paid for lab work. Hours and duties are negotiated directly with the PI. These positions are **not** advertised through a central system — you need to ask the PI directly if they have funds to hire you.

**Can I get both pay AND course credit?** YES! You can be paid as an OPS employee and also receive research credit (BSC 4910, BSC 4912, BOT 4911, ZOO 4911), but you must complete additional forms through the Biology Undergraduate Coordinator.

---

### Federal Work-Study (FWS)

**Pay:** Typically $15–$20/hour  
**Commitment:** Up to 20 hours/week during the semester  
**Eligibility:** Must demonstrate financial need on FAFSA and receive Federal Work-Study award

If you have Federal Work-Study in your financial aid package, PIs can hire you and a portion of your wages are covered by the federal government, making you less expensive to employ. Contact me if you have FWS — this makes it much easier for me to hire you.

**How to find FWS positions:**
- Go to [https://explore.jobs.ufl.edu](https://explore.jobs.ufl.edu)
- Choose "Explore Jobs at UF"
- For "Work Type," choose "Student Ast."
- Search for "Federal Work Study" + "research" or browse biology-related positions

**Important:** Complete your FAFSA early each year (by October 1) to maximize your chance of receiving FWS funding.

## Research for Course Credit (Unpaid, But Documented)

### BSC 4910, BSC 4912, BOT 4911, ZOO 4911

**Credit hours:** 0–3 credits  
**Cost:** 0-credit courses are FREE (no tuition); 1–3 credits count toward your tuition cap if you're full-time  
**Benefits:** Documents research experience on your transcript; can be repeated for up to 6 total credits

Research credit is a great way to formalize your research experience even if you're not getting paid. Many graduate programs and professional schools look for research credit on transcripts.

**How it works:**
1. Find a faculty mentor (me!) and agree on a project
2. Complete the research proposal and application form (due before the first week of classes)
3. Register for the appropriate course
4. Submit a final written report at the end of the semester (length depends on credit hours: 750 words/1 credit, 1300 words/2 credits, etc.)

**Co-requisite for Biology majors entering research for the first time:** You must also enroll in **BSC 3911 Entering Research** (1 credit) alongside BSC 4910 the first time you do research for credit.

- **Application forms:** [https://biology.ufl.edu/undergraduates/research/](https://biology.ufl.edu/undergraduates/research/)

## How to Get Started

1. **Talk to me first.** Let me know you're interested in paid research and we'll discuss current projects and your interests.

2. **Identify which funding mechanism fits you:**
   - Freshman/sophomore with no research experience? → **Emerging Scholars**
   - Junior/senior with strong academics? → **University Scholars**
   - Have Federal Work-Study? → **Tell me immediately** — this makes hiring you much easier
   - Want summer full-time work? → **SURF** or direct OPS employment
   - Computational/bioinformatics focus? → **AI Scholars**

3. **Check deadlines early.** Most competitive programs have fall or early spring deadlines. Plan ahead!

4. **Start with volunteer or credit, then apply for funding.** Many successful paid research students start by volunteering or taking research credit for a semester, then apply for competitive scholarships once they have experience and a strong relationship with their mentor.

5. **Visit the Center for Undergraduate Research (CUR)** at 202 Newell Hall for peer advising and help navigating applications.
