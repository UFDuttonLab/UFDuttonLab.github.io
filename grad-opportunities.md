## Master's and PhD Students

Thank you for your interest in pursuing graduate research in the Dutton Lab at the University of Florida! I am actively recruiting motivated graduate students interested in ecosystem ecology, microbiomes, conservation biology, and related fields.

### Research Focus Areas

Our lab pursues interdisciplinary research at the intersection of:

- **Ecosystem ecology** and biogeochemistry
- **Microbial ecology** and metagenomics
- **Wildlife conservation** and zoogeochemistry
- **Environmental DNA** and molecular ecology
- **Water quality monitoring** and aquatic ecosystems
- **Conservation genomics** and community ecology

We conduct field work in Africa (Kenya, South Africa), Florida, and other ecosystems, combined with cutting-edge laboratory automation, nanopore sequencing, and bioinformatics approaches.

### How to Contact Me

If you are interested in pursuing graduate research in the Dutton Lab, please send me an email with the following information:

Send me an email with the following...

**Subject Line:** "Prospective Graduate Student - [Your Name]"

**Please include:**
1. A brief cover letter (1 page) describing your research interests, career goals, and why you're interested in our lab
2. Your CV including publications or research experience
3. A brief description of a potential research project or area you'd like to pursue (1 paragraph)

I read all emails personally and encourage you to also explore fellowship funding opportunities below to strengthen your application and secure independent support for your graduate work. It is possible to be admitted on a Teaching Assistantship into the Biology Graduate program but can be difficult. Coming in with your own money or on a grant is a bit easier to get admitted into the program.
