## Prospective Postdoctoral Researchers

Thank you for your interest in joining the Dutton Lab at the University of Florida! I welcome inquiries from highly motivated postdoctoral researchers interested in ecosystem ecology, microbiomes, conservation biology, and related fields.

### Research Focus Areas

Our lab pursues interdisciplinary research at the intersection of:

- **Ecosystem ecology** and biogeochemistry
- **Microbial ecology** and metagenomics
- **Wildlife conservation** and zoogeochemistry
- **Environmental DNA** and molecular ecology
- **Water quality monitoring** and aquatic ecosystems
- **Conservation genomics** and community ecology

We conduct field work in Africa (Kenya, South Africa), Florida, and other ecosystems, combined with cutting-edge laboratory automation, nanopore sequencing, and bioinformatics approaches.
