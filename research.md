My research is focused on understanding the causes and consequences of ecological change.

## Animal mediated change
A key component of my research is understanding how animals can alter their environments.

## Development of novel methods
I work to develop novel methods to assist management agencies in learning more about their environments.

## Use of open source tools
I use a variety of open source tools and techniques to help document environmental change.
